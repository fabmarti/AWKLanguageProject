# AWKLanguageProject
Based off "Little Languages" from the AWK Language that parses data and prints a graph with data and ticks

The challenge of this was to transform something that was simply written in one language, to one written in C++.  The original language was similar to scripting languages like Python.  However, by transforming a high-level language into a lower one, the adaptation becomes much MUCH longer.

I enjoyed doing this for class as my final project.  I spent about a week on it before having to turn it in.  I couldn't quite figure out all the errors, which mainly consisted of "bottom_ticks" and "left_ticks" as mentioned in my Main.cpp file.  If someone can find the issues in my Graph.cpp file, please help me out with that!
